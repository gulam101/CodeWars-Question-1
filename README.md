# CodeWars-Question-1
Completed the first question on CodeWars

This was a simple C# question on CodeWars. I had to solve the problem in order to create an account. In order for me to solve this I had multiply a and b for the return method. I could also check if it is correct because I could see the test cases. 

In this application the test cases are not included, however, I will add them in.
